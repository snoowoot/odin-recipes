<p>This spiced nuts recipe is made using a much easier technique than the stovetop pan method. You'll get beautiful, perfectly frosted nuts roasted evenly, with no bitter burned spots.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 cup untoasted walnut halves</li>
    <li>1 cup untoasted pecan halves</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted, dry roasted almonds</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted, dry roasted cashews</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Combine walnuts, pecans, almonds, and cashews in a large bowl. Add salt, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne; toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Heat sugar, water, and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Slowly pour butter mixture over nuts and stir to coat.</li>
    <li>Transfer nuts to the prepared baking sheet and spread into a single layer.</li>
    <li>Bake nuts in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir nuts to coat with warm syrup; spread out in a single layer. Return to the oven and bake until nuts are sticky and roasted, about 6 more minutes. Allow to cool before serving.</li>
