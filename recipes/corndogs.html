<p>I despise all the additives in store-bought corn dogs, so this recipe makes me happy!
</p>
<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup cold whole milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>16 large hot dogs</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>16 skewers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Direction</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; stir in milk and egg until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook hot dogs in boiling water until heated through, about 7 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and let rest for 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Insert one skewer into each hot dog and blot dry if wet. Pour chilled batter into a tall drinking glass.</li>
    <li>Dip one hot dog into batter until well coated; transfer to hot oil. Repeat with as many hot dogs as can comfortably fit in the fryer without overcrowding (one or two more). Fry until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat to coat and fry remaining hot dogs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>If you have more time, refrigerate the batter in Step 1 for up to an hour. A colder batter works better to coat the hot dogs.
